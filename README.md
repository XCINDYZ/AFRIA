# AFRIA
We present AFRIA (Automated Fundamental Rights Impact Assessment), a LLM-based tool that automates parts of fundamental rights impact assessment (FRIA). Our pipeline takes inspiration from the AHA! model (see https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2306.03280) by generating harms a stakeholder could experience when AI is deployed in a certain scenario. We also extended on AHA!'s model by looking at the FRIA requirements of the AI Act and scholarly critique. 



Steps:
1) Generating stakeholders
2) Generating vignettes
3) Generating harms
4) Generating human rights impacts
5) Generating harm mitigation measures
6) Generating severity and likelihood of harms
